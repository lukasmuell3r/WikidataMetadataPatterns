# Analyzing the Use of Metadata in the Wikidata Data Model
This repository contains the analysis data and source code used for my bachelor thesis "Analyzing the Use of Metadata in the Wikidata Date Model".

## Source code
With the Python scripts contained in the `source code` directory, it is possible to perform the complete analysis. There is a separate `README` file in this folder to briefly explain the process and the scripts.

## Analysis
In the `analysis` directory, you will find two directories.

- The `methodology` subdirectory contains all the files created during the step-by-step execution of the methodology in the thesis.
The files have been created with the scripts in the `source code` directory. There it is explained from which step of the Methodology the files are derived accordingly.
- The `results` subdirectory contains the final results of the analysis in Chapter 5 of the thesis. The explanation of these files is provided in the thesis.
There you can find the analysis as `.xlsx` and `.ods` file. The `result.json` file, which contains the complete relevant class hierarchy per pattern is also available, so that the weighting and other measurements can be traced. Additionally, a file containing detected modeling errors is included.
